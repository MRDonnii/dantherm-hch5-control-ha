# Dantherm HCH PassiveLink

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MRDonnii/dantherm-hch-passivelink/main/assets/logo.png" alt="Dantherm HCH PassiveLink logo" width="140">

An unofficial, read-only Home Assistant integration for a Dantherm HCH5 MK1 with HAC1. The integration decodes internal Modbus RTU traffic without transmitting. The companion gateway is passive by default, with an [opt-in synchronized temperature read mode](gateway/README.md#synchronized-temperature-snapshots-opt-in) for verified installations.

## Safety model

The integration supports a raw TCP stream or a USB-RS485 adapter connected directly to the Home Assistant host. Both modes **only receive bytes** and contain no Modbus request generator or serial write call. Configure the serial side as `19200 8E1`. For Ethernet adapters, disable polling, Modbus TCP conversion, MQTT and any heartbeat or registration data sent over the serial port.

For direct USB use, select **USB-RS485** during setup and enter a stable path such as `/dev/serial/by-id/...`. Home Assistant must have permission to access that device, and no other process may open the same serial port.

Do not use an M-Bus gateway. M-Bus is electrically incompatible with RS485.

## Why it is read-only

Our observations of the HCH5 MK1 + HAC1 installation show an existing controller acting as the Modbus RTU master. It continuously sends requests, and the ventilation unit replies as a slave. Those request/response frames already contain the operating values needed by Home Assistant, so this integration can decode them without polling the unit itself.

The installation is operated as a single-master Modbus RTU bus. A second device can technically transmit a valid command, and the unit may accept it temporarily. However, the existing master continues its normal control cycle and writes its own state again, so the external value is overwritten. Two independent transmitters on the same RS485 pair also have no arbitration: their frames can overlap, cause CRC and timeout errors, disturb the existing controller and potentially produce unintended behaviour.

Because writes would be unreliable, temporary and potentially disruptive, read-only operation is a deliberate design and safety choice rather than a missing feature:

- the gateway listens to both directions of the existing RS485 exchange;
- the gateway forwards the observed bytes as an unchanged raw TCP stream;
- the Home Assistant integration only receives and decodes that stream;
- neither the gateway nor the integration may poll, acknowledge or write to the bus.

A transparent RS485-to-Ethernet adapter is suitable when it can expose the observed serial bytes as a raw TCP stream without generating its own serial traffic. The integration never writes data to its TCP connection. Do not connect other software that sends data through the adapter.

### Adapter setup

![Passive RS485 wiring diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MRDonnii/dantherm-hch-passivelink/main/docs/rs485-wiring.svg)

#### Wiring the RS485 side

Turn off the ventilation system and adapter while making or changing the
wiring. Leave the existing HAC1/HCP4-to-HCH connection intact: PassiveLink is a
**parallel receive-only tap**, not a replacement controller and not a new bus
master.

| Existing RS485 bus | Waveshare / common adapter label | USB-RS485 label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A`, `485+` or `D+` | `485A` / `A+` | `A` / `D+` |
| `B`, `485-` or `D-` | `485B` / `B-` | `B` / `D-` |
| Signal reference, if present | `GND` / `SGND` | `GND` |

Connect A to A and B to B in parallel with the two existing bus conductors. Do
not infer wire function from colour alone. Manufacturers do not always use A/B
consistently; if no valid frames are received, power down and swap only A and B.
Connect signal ground only when both device manuals provide a signal-reference
terminal—never connect protective earth or a power-supply conductor as RS485
ground.

Do not add another 120 Ω terminator just because an adapter has a termination
switch. The existing working bus is already terminated for its topology; an
extra terminator on a short parallel tap can load it unnecessarily. Keep the
new branch short, use a twisted pair, and have an authorised installer handle
the connection if the Dantherm terminals or cable functions are uncertain.

For the Waveshare RS485 TO POE ETH (B), use the PoE RJ45 socket only for
Ethernet and power. The RS485 pair belongs on the separate screw terminals
marked `485A` and `485B`; an RJ45 plug is not itself an RS485 pinout.

Configure the adapter before adding the integration:

- serial interface: RS485;
- baud rate: `19200`;
- data format: `8E1` (8 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit);
- network mode: transparent/raw TCP server;
- protocol conversion: disabled;
- active polling, MQTT and serial heartbeat/registration packets: disabled.
- termination resistor: unchanged/off unless the existing bus design requires it.

Connect the adapter passively to the same RS485 A/B pair and enter the adapter's own IP address and TCP listening port in Home Assistant. The address and port are chosen in the adapter configuration and are not fixed by this integration.

A detailed Danish explanation of the findings is available in [docs/findings.da.md](docs/findings.da.md).

### Raspberry Pi gateway project

The [`gateway/`](gateway/) folder is a self-contained, low-cost Raspberry Pi
project with the receive-only bridge, systemd services, a reusable
configuration file and an installer. It is suitable for a Raspberry Pi 2B or
newer with a Linux-compatible USB-RS485 adapter. The optional DS18B20 water
temperature extension is isolated from the core bridge and is not required.

The guides cover hardware, wiring, fixed addressing, installation, automatic
startup, watchdog recovery, firewalling, Home Assistant setup and
troubleshooting.

## Entities

Temperatures, CO₂, three after-heater thermostat setpoints, both fan speeds and control percentages, operating mode, ventilation level, bypass, fireplace/standby/night states, HAC1 connectivity, persistent filter life and raw diagnostic values. Unverified raw values are disabled by default and are deliberately not presented with misleading units.

Two derived temperature sensors: extraction-side heat-recovery efficiency and the supply/extract temperature delta. Calculations use the ventilation unit's own outdoor-air sensor, so no external weather integration is required. A CO2-derived air quality index (good/moderate/poor) and an RS485 frames-per-minute diagnostic sensor (a leading indicator of wiring/adapter degradation) round out the set.

An optional water-preheater extension can read two DS18B20 probes connected to a Raspberry Pi. It exposes flow, return, water delta-T, heat-transfer state and sensor connectivity as a separate Home Assistant device. The extension is disabled by default and deliberately isolated from the RS485 connection: missing probes, a stopped temperature service or an unreachable Pi only make these optional entities unavailable. The main Dantherm integration continues normally.

Valid heat-recovery measurements are classified as good (85% or higher), acceptable (70–84.9%) or low. PassiveLink learns a slowly changing local reference and reports the drop as normal, watch (7.5 percentage points) or degraded (12.5 percentage points). Bypass and invalid temperature spans are excluded. Fan-control and RPM deltas are change indicators, not calibrated airflow measurements.

A "Reset filter interval" button lets you mark the filter as changed from Home Assistant — it only resets the locally tracked cycle and never writes to the bus. If the gateway connection or the HAC1 module stays unreachable for more than 15 minutes, PassiveLink raises a Home Assistant Repairs issue and clears it automatically once the link recovers.

Up to the latest 20 locally confirmed filter changes are retained. The last change and number of recorded changes are available as diagnostic sensors.

Filter life is kept locally from the last synchronized HCP4 reset time and
interval. The integration exposes the interval, days remaining, percentage,
status, alarm and data source, and advances the countdown without requiring
continuous filter telegrams.

Filter warnings are configurable under the integration's options. Home
Assistant can create a persistent notification and optionally send the same
message through a selected `notify.mobile_app_...` service. The warning is sent
once per filter cycle when the configured remaining-days threshold is reached.

The after-heater thermostat settings are only transmitted when the HCP4 writes
them. PassiveLink restores their last observed states after a Home Assistant
restart because a passive listener cannot request them again.

The supply-air setpoint is not continuously present on every observed bus.
When it is absent, the upstream serial gateway must optionally perform a
read-only Modbus query of HAC1 registers 185–189 and forward the complete RTU
response to its raw TCP clients. This is how the reference gateway obtains the
value. It does not write a setting, but it does transmit a read request and is
therefore not strictly passive during that query. Do not enable such polling on
a bus where a second requester cannot be operated safely. A plain transparent
adapter without this upstream query can still expose the other passive values,
while the supply-air setpoint remains unavailable until observed.

Names and setup text are included in Danish and English and follow the selected Home Assistant language.

## Installation with HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add this repository to HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=MRDonnii&repository=dantherm-hch-passivelink&category=integration)

1. Use `https://github.com/MRDonnii/dantherm-hch-passivelink` as a HACS custom repository.
2. In HACS, add that URL as a custom repository of type **Integration**.
3. Install **Dantherm HCH PassiveLink** and restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the integration under **Settings → Devices & services**.
5. Enter the IP address and raw TCP listening port configured on the RS485-to-Ethernet adapter.

If the adapter address changes later, reconfigure the integration with its new host and port.

## Compatibility

The decoder is based on controlled observations from one HCH5 MK1 + HAC1 installation. It is not intended for HCH5 MKII or newer units that provide official Modbus TCP.

Dantherm Group has not supplied this integration and provides no support or warranty for it.
